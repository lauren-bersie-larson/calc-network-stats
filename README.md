# calc-network-stats
Codes for computing fiber network metrics 

NOTE: In order to analyze all network .mat files in a given folder, I wrote these scripts to utilize the codes for natural-order filename sort found on the Matlab file exchange (Stephen (2022). Natural-Order Filename Sort (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47434-natural-order-filename-sort), MATLAB Central File Exchange) 
These codes for natural-order filename sort (natsort.m, natsortfiles.m) are not my own and I do not take credit or provide support for them. Download the scripts from the link above to use, or simply comment out the lines that call these functions and replace with your own preferred method of looping through network files as you see fit.
